            <div class="halfwidth">
                
            <div><p>Our first major project in Intro to Game Technologies and Mechanics was to make a 3D, first-person puzzle game in the style of the ridiculously popular 1993 point-and-click, “Myst.” I loved playing Myst and Riven as a kid (although I was terrible at them) and I instantly had very strong ideas for what I wanted my puzzles and my island to look like. I called it Turtle Island.</p>
                
            <p>Turtle Island’s design was inspired by the islands in Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, which feel organically structured while you walk around on them but are clearly based on a drawn shape when viewed on the map from above. The central “shell” area provides a sort of hub that the player starts in, as well as the final puzzle. The fanned-out “front fins” provide isolated areas for two puzzles to take place in.</p>
                
            <p>When making the actual turtle island in Unity, I tried to make it more asymmetrical and organic in shape. The original map was much larger, and included a back-end “sandbar” area of the turtle that allowed players to walk down into the water for exploration & collectibles. I ended up drastically reducing the size of the map as well as the scope of the game. Unity’s terrain system made wading around in the water and climbing back up onto the turtle difficult, I didn’t have enough content to tightly populate the area and it just wasn’t that fun. The new map is considerably smaller compared to its 3D-modeled contents (less running around in general) and has invisible walls to prevent falling into the ocean as this was the thing my partner (and primary playtester) found most annoying.</p></div>
                
            <div><p>Players start in the central amphitheatre/hub area in the centre of the turtle. The first puzzle is visible here, but not possible to solve without just bruteforcing it (something a later playtester did!) Three colored monoliths (with an indicator on the ground pointing to one side) can be spun around to show different animal faces. You can find the solution to this puzzle around the island.</p>
                
            <p>The first key/gem is visible here underneath a cage. Originally the cage just disappeared when you solved the puzzle, but I was told this wasn’t obvious enough by a playtester, so I changed it to rise into the air slowly (with a chime sound effect). Spinning the monoliths was the first puzzle I programmed in – as soon as we had access to the iTween animation language I hit the ground running! Directly behind where the player starts out is one of the three clue areas in the game. This is a blue field of flowers with a slowly falling glowy particle effect. Stepping into the area triggers a monolith to rise from the ground and give one of the solutions to the central monolith puzzle. When I designed this area I was just beginning to add music to my game and I had a strong vision for these 3 colored clue areas to have a different background track. The soundscape in the game is designed to be mostly diegetic. The central area’s bouncy, tropical/psychedelic soundtrack and real birdsong fades out on the periphery of the island and is replaced by a solemn, meditative song and ocean noises. The only sound that is fully non-diegetic is the sfx playing when you pick up a gem.</p></div>

                <div class="textside"><p>I was the sole programmer for two games for the Wildbase Recovery Centre in 2018, “A Day in the Life of a Kiwi Ranger” and “Diagnose Me!”. They were programmed in RenPy, an open source Python-based engine. The graphic assets and text were provided and I worked closely with the illustrator, Massey OpenLab designers and Wildbase vet technicians to create the final products. As the programmer, I had a lot of creative control and input over the actual mechanics and functionality of the games.</p> <p>All animations visible have also been created entirely through programming. In each section with moving elements, I was given still assets and was able to use layering techniques and position adjustments to bring the scene to life. </p><p>I was very involved in the whole process of creating both games, from putting together the user interfaces to building and testing them on the final iPads. Both games are aimed towards young children (6-12). In order to allow for ambient sounds in the centre environment to shine through, the games themselves are silent.</p></div>

                    <div class="pushright">This game is a vet simulator, showing kids a variety  of the tests they might run to diagnose and treat injured native birds at the Wildbase Hospital. There are six different birds to treat, each with a different selection of available tests and a final diagnosis. This was my first time learning to implement finger-swiping touch controls. Because there was a central testing screen that the player returned to each time, it was important to use variables to keep track of which tests had already been performed or were gated to only a specific few birds, as per the vet recommendations. Much of the complexity of putting Diagnose Me! together was in small UI elements that reacted to players' taps, assembling multi-part animations and figuring out how to display a great deal of required medical information to the player in a sensible, child-friendly way!</div>

                <div class="pushleft">This game places players in the shoes of a DOC ranger, allowing them to spend a day tracking kiwi through the bush. There are four separate kiwi with different appearances and behaviors, as well as many randomized and chance-based elements throughout the game. Will the kiwi run away from the player, or hide in a burrow? Will it be healthy or ill? What other animals will you encounter? To increase the fun of hunting around in the bushes and show off some of the country's natural diversity, you are guaranteed to run into at least a few other wild native animals before you find your kiwi. Each non-kiwi animal is sensibly linked to one of the three possible locations, depending on their habitat (for example, the whio will always be in the location with water running through it). When the kiwi is first tracked, there is a small chance that it will be deceased - this is a sad fact of dealing with wild animals, but we wanted it to still feel rewarding to follow through to the end, so players complete a small detective minigame once the bird is found. Once again, the elements in this game are intended to be as close as possible to realistic DOC ranger experiences without sacrificing an enjoyable player experience.</div>

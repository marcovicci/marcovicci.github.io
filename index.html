                <div class="pushright"><p>I'm Denzelle and I make games.</p><p>In childhood, I was a hobbyist in various proprietary languages. "Furcadia" gave me "Dragonspeak" (with a full system of arrays and variables, no less!), "Starcraft" had the "StarEdit" system (with bizarre workarounds to create if-statements using character AI), and "Minecraft" famously introduced many kids to "Redstone" (a language so simple and so complex you can actually use it to make a working computer inside the game). It was a logical leap to go from trying to break and alter my favorite games to trying to make entirely new ones. In 2017-2018 I completed my first paid programming jobs through Massey's OpenLab, for permanent installation inside of the Wildbase Recovery Centre. Now I'm getting my bachelor's in Creative Media Production at Massey University to refine my skills.</p></div>

                <div class="pushleft"><p>"Martian Killer!" is what you might scream when a Martian arrives at your window in the night. Or maybe it's your job title if you hunt Martians. Or maybe it's a new, space-age slang for when something is just, like, <i>killer</i>, dude, but even more so. Games have been aesthetically related to this space explorer kind of sensibility for a long time. Is it because Space Invaders was very popular, or maybe because the concept of a video game is sci-fi in itself? Whatever the reason, we love pulpy retro-future imagery and narratives. I grew up on Ray Bradbury, so, personally, I'm on the side of the Martians.</p></div>
